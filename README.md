# Transitions_setup

<b>Export</b><br>

Just After export your .oxz file through EditOneLife.exe :<br>

-Open the .oxz file in the application (on the left)<br>
-Befor click export make sure that you are exporting the last objects in the list and not missing one ( witch could cause problem )<br>
That will create a .trt file with all the transitions who have a reference too <br>

<b>Import</b><br>

in order :<br>
-Put .trt file into "import_add" (like the .oxz)<br>
-Run EditOneLife.exe<br>
-Close after the load are done<br>
-Open the .trt file in the application (on the right)<br>
-click import<br>


In any case do it in a diferent game file to be sure to not ensure the main game file.
